When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	I would use a remtoe repository when: 1.) I either need to access a project from multiple computers, OR 2.) I am working on a group project where I will be collaborating with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	Because you could have a file in working directory or possibly in the staging area at the time of automatic up-to-date, which would lead to conflicts at the time of committing.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	Forks are clone of one GitHub repository to another GitHub repository. Clones are copy of a repository from GitHub to another location, most likely on local computers. Branches are an instance of a parent repository with user specific changes.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	This is helpful for comparison purposes when offline.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
	Collaboration without Git/GitHub would require a lot of emailing of files back and forth. Collaborating without Git/GitHub would be easier when you are working with others who are not familiar with Git/GitHub or a version control system. This would make it hard to keep track of different versions of files and who made what changes.
